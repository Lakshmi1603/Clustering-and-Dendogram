# Clustering-and-Dendogram
To build a hierarchical cluster model for the data “football.csv”  
 
 The dataset has a list of 480 players and their performance measures in football matches.  
 The coach is looking for a replacement for the player with first name: “Song” so from the list of given players and their performance metrics, build a hierarchical cluster  and choose the cluster that has a set of players who are similar to “Song”
